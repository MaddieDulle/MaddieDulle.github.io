									<p>On Friday, September 30, another successful UniDiversity Festival took place at Oxford Uptown Parks. This collaborative, annual event promotes diversity and inclusion in the community and also allows the community to learn more about the Latin American, Latino, and Caribbean cultures. Individuals from both Miami University and the Oxford community were encouraged to come out and enjoy the celebration. The festival offered a variety of live performances, information on various groups and clubs, live animals to pet, fun games and activities, multiple food trucks, and a very welcoming environment.</p>
