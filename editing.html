										<h1>Editorial Experience</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Aside from the editorial experience I've had as a student, I have also participated in a number of roles that have allowed me to sharpen my editorial skills while gaining valuable experience along the way.</p>

									<h2>Tutoring</h2>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Since my sophomore year of college, I've has served as a Level II Certified Writing Tutor for the Tutoring and Learning Center, the TLC, on campus. This work has allowed her to help countless students brainstorm, plan, revise, and edit their various assignments. These assignments have included simple one-page essays, creative works, extensive research papers, capstone projects, and more.</p> 
									<p>This role has also helped earn her, along with the TLC, a positive reputation throughout campus, as many professors often personally recommend her to students. </p>

									<h2>Working with Authors</h2>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Maddie has had the opportunity to work with a few different authors, both unpublished and published, so far in her career as a beta reader and as an intern.  
										In her role as a beta reader, Maddie spent time reading over the author's unpublished, and sometimes completely unedited, before offering feedback. This feedback would come in the form of advice on plot, character development, and theme. Although the main focus would be on the overall story, Maddie would also play the part of a copy editor by commenting on grammatical and sentence-level issues.</p> 
										<p>As an intern for Clarissa Burt, Maddie was able to learn about the publishing and editing world from the perspective of the author. She was tasked with helping Ms. Burt write up pitches for her novel, connecting with individuals in the publishing world, as well as the general promotion of the newly released book.</p>
