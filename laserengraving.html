										<h1>Laser Engravings at Gardner-Harvey Library</h1>
									</header>

									<p>There are many events that the Gardner-Harvey Library holds each month that give staff and
									students alike the chance to take a break from their work and studies in order to learn
									something new. Often, the individuals who attend are given the chance to make an item and
									take it home with them. One such event was recently held in the library’s TEC Lab. This wooden
									spoon laser engraving event encouraged students to stop by and see how the laser
									engraver—one of the many different machines the library has to offer—works. Those who did
									were able to select a cooking utensil of their choice, decide on a phrase and font to add to it,
									and then watch as the laser engraver brought their design to life in a matter of seconds.</p>
										
									<p>Once the utensil was completed, it was ready to be used in the creation of the next best dish,
									making this quick yet memorable process great for anyone who didn’t have much free time to
									spare but still wanted to participate. People who did have a few extra moments were able to
									take their time working on their perfect design and even checking out the other projects that had
									been made with the various pieces of equipment in the room. The library staff was also around
									and more than happy to answer any questions guests might have had in between running the
									laser engraver.</p>
										
									<p>TEC Lab events such as this one are held once a month in the only TEC Lab at Miami
									Regionals, which is located in room 125 of the Gardner-Harvey Library on the Middletown
									campus. The purpose of these events is to give students the opportunity to make something fun
									and unique that they can keep, while also learning a little more about each of the different
									pieces of equipment. Even if you aren’t able to come to one of these events, the chance to
									make something within the TEC Lab still exists, as the lab itself can be booked for up to two
									hours. During this time, you can work on a project independently using the equipment in the
									room, and if you ever need any assistance, the library staff is there to help.</p>
										
									<p>All upcoming library events are typically advertised through posters on campus, emails from the
									staff, and any of the library’s social media accounts. You can also find more information on
									them, as well as the TEC Lab or library in general, by visiting the library’s website:
									https://www.mid.miamioh.edu/library/</p>
