									<p>As Jake wipes up the third plate of spaghetti that's been spilt since he clocked in two hours ago, he realizes what a mistake it was to pick up yet another extra shift. When he called in asking for it, he had thought it was what he needed. He couldn't stand being alone in his recently empty apartment, forced to look at all the places that used to hold her things any longer; he wanted to feel normal, but he didn't know what normal was anymore. So the next best thing was a distraction, and what better distraction was there than the night shift at Tino's, right? So far, he'd been wrong, as the only thing the shift had given him was a lack of patience. Even with this newfound frustration, the memories of that night still manage to flood his mind when he's least expecting it, hitting him with another wave of sorrow each time. A week had gone by since then, yet the pain is still just as fresh as if it had happened mere hours before.</p> 
										
									<p><em>They walk, hand in hand, down Main Street, the same way they had on their very first date. Jake concentrates as he tries to count the steps to the exact spot where they had shared their first kiss, but she keeps making him lose focus.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>“Will you tell me what's happening please? And where we're going?” She says, with a hint of annoyance in her voice. From the moment they left dinner, heading in the opposite direction of their parked car, she has been on edge. Jake can't blame her though; They have been walking for a while, but he wants it to be perfect and knows she'll understand once his plan falls into place.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>When they finally reach the crack in the sidewalk that sits directly below the brightest streetlight in town, Jake glances around, making sure the photographer he hired is in the position they had discussed. Once he's spotted him, Jake lowers himself onto one knee—taking extra care not to let his nerves knock him over—and pulls out the ring he'd recently spent almost his entire savings on.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>It takes him a moment to steady himself enough to look up, but once he does he sees the realization flash in her eyes as she tries and fails to stifle a laugh. “Jake, you can't actually be serious,” she said, already taking a step back so that she was out of his reach.</em></p>

									<p><em>Had she looked at his face for more than a second or paid any attention to his shaking hands, she would have understood just how serious he was.</em></p>

									<p>Jake is snapped back to reality when he hears Xavier, the one and only coworker he would consider a real friend in this place, calling him through the window in the kitchen, “Jake, your presence is requested in the back.”</p>

									<p>The floor is still sticky, but this gives him the perfect excuse not to drag the ancient mop out of the supply closet. Besides, maybe the extra traction will help keep the plates of pasta in everyone's hands.</p>

									<p>He takes the long way to the kitchen, weaving in and out of tables packed too tightly. As the rest of the staff has been saying for ages, it's only a matter of time before this place gets shut down—that is if it doesn't go out of business first. He's never fully agreed before but is now starting to see the logic in the statement. Between all the barely passed health inspections, the clear fire hazards in the overly crammed dining area, and the faulty open sign hanging lopsided in the front window, it's a miracle Tino's has even stayed open this long.</p>

									<p>“And so the last of the crew has arrived,” Xavier says as Jake slips through the double doors of the kitchen and takes his usual spot in the corner. He notices that the two waitresses working tonight, Cara and Natalie, are already flipping through channels on the mini TV mounted beside the sink.</p>

									<p>Jake sighs, as he realizes what's about to happen. There's only one time a night when the restaurant is open that all its workers manage to be in the same place: when it's time to make The Bet.</p>

									<p>As the only Italian restaurant in town, and a cheap one at that, Tino's is the go-to place for any date. While many great dates have played out inside these outdated walls, it's also been known to host some of the most embarrassing breakups this town has ever seen. So, when someone walks in alone, wearing their best attire, and radiating a mix of hope and nerves—the three tell-tale signs the staff has come to recognize almost immediately—it's not always clear which of the two occasions have been set up. To provide a little bit of entertainment, the waitstaff a couple years back came up with a game that has long since become a tradition.</p> 
										
									<p>Every night the workers on hand gather in the kitchen right before the dinner rush, all but one placing their money in the pot, and wait for their victim to arrive. The first person to walk through the front doors and meet all three requirements automatically becomes the target of the night. They get seated at the infamous Heartbreak Table; the only table able to be seen from every spot in the restaurant. As the night progresses, the staff observes the victim, makes a guess of how their night will go down, and comes up with a backstory to go along with it, until the inevitable happens: either the date makes an appearance or the victim leaves as they showed up—alone. The catch: only the Insider, the server who doesn't participate, is allowed to interact with the victim and can't tell anyone else the details of what happens.</p> 
										
									<p>Due to the lack of customers Tino's has been suffering from recently and the need to keep the game away from the eyes of management, it's a hit or miss whether The Bet will happen. Although, with it being a Saturday night and the manager already having called in sick, the chances are pretty high.</p> 
										
									<p>Slapping his money into the pot, Xavier asks, “Who else will be joining me tonight?” As the cook he doesn't have the option to serve the victim so he always participates. 
										
									<p>“You know I'm in. Let's see who's gonna get their heart torn in two tonight,” Natalie says and then turns to Jake before doing her best impression of him, “You never know, it might be the opposite. Not everyone in this world is as cruel as you are, Natalie.”</p>
										
									<p>Normally Jake would agree, snapping back with something about the good that exists in most people, but after recent events, he isn't so sure and decides to stay quiet, which doesn't go unnoticed.</p>
										
									<p>“What, did Mr. Hopeful not take his happy pill today? Or did he finally get his own heart broken and come over to the pessimist way of thinking?”</p> 
										
									<p>He doesn't usually let Natalie's comments affect him, but it seems inevitable today. And maybe it's because the pain is still fresh or because this one in particular strikes a chord, but Jake thinks of her, the one responsible for shattering his heart into what feels like a million pieces, for the second time this shift only this time it's not a full memory, just bits and pieces of a night he wishes he could forget. 
										
									<p>The first thing that comes to mind is the way she pried her hands away from him and took a couple of steps back, like she no longer knew who he was and couldn't stand to be any closer to him than she had to. And then he remembers her laugh, the one he always loved. It was just a mere giggle at first, but it escalated quickly, becoming loud enough to grab the attention of everyone around them, until a crowd had formed to bask in the humiliation he felt creeping up his neck. Before Jake allows himself to fall further into the details of all that went down, he forces himself to focus on the moment at hand.</p> 
										
									<p>Ashamed, he can't bring himself to meet anyone's eyes as he responds, “I'm not feeling it today, okay? Besides, I was in last time so I think it's my turn to sit out. Cara, that means you're in,” He points at the other waitress and doesn't wait for a response before he makes his way out of the kitchen and heads towards the open sign—which is out again—in hopes of a new distraction.</p> 
										
									<p>No matter how many battery replacements it gets, the sign continues to flicker and dim, making it seem as if the restaurant is open one second then closed the next. All it needs is a bit of a jiggle to get it up and running again, something only Jake has figured out since no one else seems to care enough to do anything about it.</p> 
										
									<p>He reminds himself of this as he tries not to feel guilty about the way he stormed out on everyone. Normally, as the Insider he would happily sit in to listen to the stories they concoct and tell them how wrong they were, but not tonight. He can't deal with them today, especially with the off chance of one of their stories resembling his own.</p> 
								   
									<p>Besides, they know where to find him if or when the time comes.</p>

									<p class="line.break">…</p>
										
									<p>It's an hour or so later when Cara, a tray full of meals in her hands, brushes by Jake and quietly wishes him good luck, indicating that The Bet has begun.</p>
										
									<p>He looks up from the table he was setting and immediately spots who she's talking about. A girl wearing a simple yet elegant red dress with her makeup done and hair curled has just walked in. She's standing by the hostess table and keeps switching between checking her phone and looking around, never letting her gaze stay focused on anything too long.</p> 
										
									<p>There are still a few items to place, though with all his coworkers' eagerly glancing at him and the many tables already being unoccupied on their busiest night of the week, he feels no need to follow through with the task at the moment.</p> 
										
									<p>Making his way towards her, he suspects this girl has no idea what she's walked into. She probably believes she looks like everyone else seeking a meal from Tino's—no one worth paying any extra attention to. Knowing just how wrong she is, Jake wants to tell her to look closer; it's not hard to notice that the eyes of every worker gravitated to her the moment she stepped through the doors, trying to figure her out from afar. They've all been trained to know the signs like the back of their hands—nicely dressed, alone, nervous—and this girl checks every box, no matter how hard she tries to hide it. Jake can tell she thinks it's going to be a special night, one she will always remember. What she doesn't understand is that it no doubt will be memorable, though it won't be how she hopes if any of the waitstaff have it their way.</p> 
										
									<p>Jake can't remember the last time he went to church, but just as he reaches the hostess stand, he finds himself having a quick one-sided conversation with God. The last thing anyone needs is to experience a heartbreak like the one he's still reeling from, especially this girl who's so obviously glowing with excitement.
										
									<p>He greets her with their overly scripted welcome speech and proceeds to ask how many will be in her party even though he suspects he already knows the answer.</p> 
										
									<p>“Two please, my fianc-,” she slaps a hand over her mouth, but it doesn't fully cover the giddy smile that lights up her face as she corrects herself, “I mean boyfriend, whoops, will be joining me shortly.”</p> 
										
									<p>Even though there's not a soul around who it will matter to if Jake tells, the girl still feels the need to express her concern as he grabs two menus and leads her to the Heartbreak Table, “Listen, so I might have found out that my boyfriend plans on proposing tonight, and I really don't want to ruin what he has planned, despite my slip up. So if you wouldn't mind, I'd love to keep that bit of information between the two of us, you know?” She trails off, unsure of how to go on.</p> 
										
									<p>Jake smiles, appreciating the respect she has for the planning that goes into a proposal, “Of course, ma'am. I wouldn't want to be the one to ruin your special night.” At least there's someone still out there that takes a life changing event like this seriously. Jake just hopes the same can be said about the girl's boyfriend.</p>

									<p>“Oh, thank you so much,” she says, and then grabs his hand as she continues, “And I feel so rude asking this, but can you do me a favor?”</p>

									<p>He freezes; the last time he was asked for a favor was a week ago. The situations were completely different—he wasn't the vulnerable one and it had been another girl holding his hand—yet the simple gesture and similar request forces him back to that awful night he can't seem to forget.</p> 
										
								   	<p><em> He pushes the ring box out towards her and opens it. He faintly hears the click of a camera over the thumping of his own heart and knows that's his que to begin the speech he's been practicing on their dog when she wasn't home. So, with as much confidence as he can manage, he does, “Five years ago today, in this very spot, we shared our very first kiss. Call me a hopeless romantic, but I knew right then and there that you—”</em></p>
										
									<p><em>“Jake stop,” she hisses under her breath. Since the beginning of summer is nearing, it isn't a cold night, yet she crosses her arms over her chest and tucks her hands into the folds of her dress. She's refusing to look at him, instead choosing to glance around the now increasingly busy street.</em></p>
										
									<p><em>Jake, suddenly aware of the crowd of spectators that seems to be forming around the two of them, feels his cheeks start to heat up. It's not until she spots the photographer—no longer hidden in order to capture the moment through the line of people surrounding them—that hers begin to do the same. She's never been a fan of public displays, but when the idea for the date had come to mind, he couldn't imagine a better way to ask for her to spend the rest of their lives together. Since then, he's been planning out every second for months.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>It's this thought of all the hours and effort he put into this that makes him decide he won't let a few nosy people and a bit of embarrassment ruin it for either one of them. Before he can even get out another word though, she steps forward and takes his hands in hers, pulling upwards ever so slightly, “Jake, please. Just do me a favor…”</em></p>
										
									<p><em>He doesn't understand what she is asking because all he can think about in that instant is why it's taking her so long to say yes.</em></p> 
										
									<p>The slight squeeze his fingers feel is what brings him back this time. He shakes his head, trying to clear it of the memory, and apologizes.</p> 
										
									<p>The girl quickly brushes off his unprofessionalism, muttering something about off-days, and continues with her request.</p> 
									
									<p>“I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind keeping an eye out for my, uh, boyfriend? I'm sure you're busy, but I want to make sure he knows where I am when he comes in and two sets of eyes are better than one. He's driving a red Mustang. He just got it so it'll probably be the cleanest car out there—he acts like it's his baby, always coddling it and stressing over it. I tried to tell him it wasn't a smart decision when it comes to finances and safety but he's been wanting it for a while now so there was no talking him out of it, though I guess that's beside the point. Anyways, do you think you could do that for me?”</p> 
										
									<p>Jake promises to do his best then jots down her drink request—the only thing she was willing to order without her date. He stops at a few of his other tables as well before making his way back to the kitchen.</p>

									<p>After filling an ice water and grabbing an extra set of silverware, he's just about to return when Xavier steps in front of the door, blocking his path out. “Hey man, what's going on?”</p> 
										
									<p>Jake understands the underlying question, as it was one he had been anticipating all week, but chooses to play dumb anyways and puts one hand in the air, “Listen you know the rules, I can't tell you anything about the girl. Even if you are my friend.”</p>
										
									<p>Xavier lets out a small laugh, “As if I need to cheat to win. But seriously, I meant what's going on with you. You're not acting like your normal cheerful self, and you weren't even scheduled to work tonight, again. Since when do you ask for extra shifts?”</p>
										
									<p>His question reminds Jake of last weekend when she had asked him something similar. “Jake you're acting weird, is something going on? What aren't you telling me? I thought this was supposed to be a fun night.”</p>
										
									<p>Jake wants to tell him everything—how long it had taken to plan out their night and how quickly it went wrong, the way he should of seen it coming but was too busy being Mr. Hopeful as Natalie calls him to pick up on any of the signs, the extra shifts he's been covering not only as a distraction but to try to remember how he got that nickname in the first place, and so much more—but he holds back. He doesn't know if he would be able to talk about any of it without breaking down so instead he averts his eyes, choosing to stay quiet. Any excuse he gives is going to be a crappy one.</p> 
										
									<p>Thankfully Xavier seems to pick up on his hesitation and drops the subject, instead moving out of the way and letting him pass, “Well, since you're here we might as well take advantage of you. Cara said the sign's out again and you're still the only one who can fix it, so go work your magic.”</p>
										
									<p>Jake, grateful to have such a good friend, nods as he leaves Xavier behind in the kitchen and ventures over to the open sign.</p> 
										
									<p>Xavier wasn't lying, it's so dim you can barely see the neon lights reflecting back in the window. Jake gives it a good shake and waits. After a minute, it slowly flickers back to life and once he's sure it'll stay that way, at least for the time being, he gets back to checking on each of his tables.</p>

									<p class="line.break">…</p>

								   	<p>Forty-five minutes have passed since the girl, who Jake has since learned is named Kaiden, first sat down at the Heartbreak Table and still she remains alone. Normally this is the point when the victims' confidence starts to crumble as they realize their date probably isn't going to show up, at least not in the way they hope, but this isn't the case with Kaiden.</p> 
										
									<p>So far, she has remained optimistic; the excitement and jitters she clearly had when she first arrived still appear to radiate off her. The waitstaff seem to think this means that her breakup is going to be the worst one they've bet on in a while, especially Natalie. Jake, despite his best efforts to keep away from their guesses tonight, had overheard her telling Cara how Kaiden was going to “run out of here weeping.” 
										
									<p>Jake on the other hand isn't so sure. He's come to realize that Kaiden is different from the other breakup victims he's encountered. Instead of sitting in silence and watching the minutes tick by, Kaiden has resorted to starting little conversations with Jake every chance she gets. The topics don't really seem to have any rhyme or reason to them, just things that come to mind when Jake checks in on her—from the history of parmesan cheese and using oil versus water to cook pasta noodles to shitty first jobs and bad parenting skills—but all have brought a smile to his face. Even when the topics veer towards the future she sees with her boyfriend Jake still finds himself enjoying the chance to learn about Kaiden, despite the fact that these often remind him of the bright future he used to imagine for him and his girlfriend.</p>
										
									<p>There is one in particular, about the dog breed she hopes to have, that is able to bring Jake back to the first happy memory since that fateful night: the day they decided on the dog to adopt from the local shelter. To most, this moment would be insignificant compared to the day the dog was able to be brought home, but to him it meant just as much.</p> 
										
									<p><em>The two are sitting on their couch, wrapped in a giant blanket, and consumed by the laptop screens sitting in front of them. The TV plays in the background, though they couldn't tell you what show is on since the movie they chose ended an hour ago. Even before the credit scenes began rolling, they were too wrapped up in their search to be paying any attention.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>It has been months of going through website after website, scouring the internet for a dog to adopt, but Jake doesn't mind. He can't remember a time when she was more invested in anything so he's happy to devote as many months as it takes to make the perfect match.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>Just when he thinks he's found one, she screams out, hitting him across the arm to let him know she's done the same. Excitement fills his body as the two try to decide on who should go first. “You go ahead,” they say at the same time. “No, you!” they say again.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>“I think we should do it together,” she says, between bursts of laughter.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>“On the count of three?” She nods, and the two begin counting, flipping their computers to face the other once they make it to three.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>When he sees her screen, he realizes that the dog she picked out is the one being displayed on his own screen. Miraculously, they had both found the same dog from the same organization. As he stares at the adoption page, he doesn't just see a dog in that picture, but a family he's starting with her. It may be small now, but he imagines what it will look like years down the road as they've had time to grow it together and he can't wait.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>Coming to the same realization, she abandons her computer and embraces him. He doesn't have to ask to know that they just found their dog.</em></p> 
									
									<p><em>Squeezing her tighter, he says through her hair, “We need to schedule the adoption as soon as possible.”</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>“You make the call, and I'll get the champaign. We finally found one!” She says, giving him one last kiss before getting up and heading towards the kitchen.</em></p> 
										
									<p>Thinking of this memory made him smile. Of course, it no longer gives him the same warm feeling it used to as it is tainted with the events from last weekend, just like every other memory she made an appearance in is, but hearing Kaiden talk of her own dog search reminds him of how he felt about that day before everything went wrong.</p> 
										
									<p>So maybe it's this small talk and variety of life stories, or possibly the bits and pieces of his old self that still exist, but he can't seem to accept that Natalie might be right. He wants to believe that Kaiden isn't the only one that's different, maybe this boyfriend of hers is too.</p> 
										
									<p>As he goes up to check on her again, he notices she's on the phone. He slows his pace, trying not to eavesdrop, but can't help overhearing part of the conversation.</p> 
										
									<p>“So, you haven't heard from him then?... No, no. It's fine. I've only been here for a little bit, and I don't want to ruin the night he has planned. I'm sure he'll show up soon. Hey, I've gotta go, I'll talk to you later,” She puts the phone down and turns to him, “Sorry about that. I was just calling to check on my boyfriend. He said he might be a little late, but I wasn't expecting to have to wait this long. I'm sure it has to do with the surprise.”</p>
										
									<p>“I'm sure that's what it is,” Jake hears the question in her voice and flashes her what he hopes is his most reassuring smile, “Can I get you another refill and maybe an appetizer while you wait?”</p>
									
									<p>She nods her head, more to herself than him, and gives him a half, though still grateful, grin as she waves him away. With that, Jake takes his leave.</p> 
										
									<p>In the time he takes to talk to Kaiden, most of his tables are nearing the point when they'll be asking for checks. He mentally prepares for the oncoming rush as he heads to the back to grab a handful of to-go boxes, only stopping once to fix the open sign, which, to his surprise, came back to life quicker than usual this time.</p> 
									
									<p class="line.break">…</p>
										
									<p>Jake feels like he's fighting a losing battle as he rushes around the restaurant, maneuvering between tables and leaving customers, trying to take care of the remaining people. Whenever he feels like he has it under control, another customer stops him and gives him more requests to fill. And it's not until the end of the rush, when all but two tables have gone, that he's able to check on Kaiden again, at least from a distance.</p> 
										
									<p>She's twirling her straw in what he suspects is a warm lemonade, the ice having already melted, and looking around when he notices her picking up her phone again. He's too far away to hear anything, but her expression tells him whatever it is isn't good; one second she's sitting at the table fidgeting with her drink and the next she's frozen in her seat, her face drained of all its color. He watches as she grabs her purse and scrambles out of the booth, tossing some bills over her shoulder as she makes her quick exit. Unfortunately, the need to get out of a situation as quickly as possible is something he knows all too well.</p> 
										
									<p><em>He raises himself off of his knee and tries to ignore the people around them, “You know I'll do anything for you, just name it.”</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>She sighs and starts to say something, but Jake cuts her off, “Do you want the wedding dress of your dreams? It's already worked into the budget! What about a bigger apartment? Consider it bought!”</em></p>
										
									<p><em>He takes a step towards her, his arms outstretched and ready to wrap around her in an embrace he's been anticipating since the date started, but she takes another step away from him.</em></p> 
									
									<p><em>“Jake—”</em></p>
										
									<p><em>“Or a bigger car, possibly one that's safe for kids. I'm sure we can find a model that won't make us uncool parents.”</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>“No, Jake, listen—”</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>She finally stops moving away and lets him take hold of her hands, which only encourages him. “You're right, we're too young. Maybe we won't even have kids, I don't know. What I do know though, is that whatever the future holds I'll be happy as long as I'm with yo—”</em></p>
										
									<p><em>“I don't want to marry you!” she yells, loud enough so that the whole street can hear it. This not only stops Jake in his tracks but leaves him speechless. He must have heard her wrong; the love of his life couldn't have just rejected his proposal.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>She pulls her hands from his and starts to fidget with the chain of her purse. “Jake, I've been trying to tell you for a while now, and I thought you were starting to see it too,” she says, gesturing between the two of them, “This—us—we aren't working out.”</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>The audible gasps that come from the people around them seem to be the last straw as Jake jerks away from her and snaps at them, “Back the hell off, all of you!”</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>Facing her once more, a new wave of heat rushes to his cheeks, the horror of what he just did already sinking in. He takes a deep breath, trying to control his racing heart, then asks her if they can go someone private. It's only a second before she agrees, but even the slightest hesitation she seems to have about being alone with him hurts.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>As they walk, he goes to place his hand on her lower back, intending to guide her through the crowd, but drops his hand suddenly realizing the gesture is no longer appropriate. Not that she would have noticed, as she's been focused on her phone since they started walking away probably to avoid a conversation with him as long as possible. It's in this moment that he also spots the photographer, unsure of what to do, so Jake waves him off. He doesn't need any more evidence of how wrong this night has gone.</em></p>
										
									<p><em>She stops him, closer to the crowd than he would have preferred, and doesn't give him a chance to say anything before explaining just how long she's been wanting to break up with him.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>“Please, can we not work on this? If there's something I can fix, I'll do it,” he says, begging her to not give up so easily.</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>“Jake, it's over.”</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>“Wow. Okay, well I guess we can work out the details on the way back to the car.”</em></p>
										
									<p><em>She pulls away again and points behind her towards the street, “Actually, I already have a ride coming. I'm so sorry, Jake.”</em></p> 
										
									<p><em>Utterly defeated and knowing he won't be able to keep himself from breaking down for much longer, he gives her a tight smile before walking away from her and any hopes of having a life together.</em></p>  
										
									<p>So caught up with what just happened and the onslaught of his own memories, Jake didn't notice Natalie coming up beside him, “Looks like she left crying just as I predicted. I say that counts as a win, wouldn't you Mr. Hopeful?”</p>
										
									<p>Jake barely registers what she says, still trying to process the scene that just unfolded before him, but nods anyways.</p> 
										
									<p>“Okay, well if it's cool with you I'm gonna go tell the others what happened and collect my prize. You've got the remaining tables, right?” She doesn't wait for him to agree, just heads back to the kitchen, leaving Jake still standing there.</p> 
										
									<p>He takes a moment to try to collect himself and then continues waiting on the final tables, receiving some nasty glares from customers that had been friendly up until now, but he can't blame them for his sudden shift in moods.</p> 
										
									<p>Once he's finished, and the last of the customers leave for the night, he makes his way back to the kitchen, preparing himself for the full celebration mode everyone is bound to be in. He expects Natalie to be the most excited, with it being her personal win, though Cara and Xavier will share her joy because successful Bets are few and far between these days, but as he walks in he finds the exact opposite.</p> 
										
									<p>There are no whoops and cheers, jumps of joy, or friendly trash talking about losers; instead, there's complete silence. The three are huddled together by the sink, their eyes glued to a program on the mini TV Jake can't see from where he stands. Curious as to what has them all so intrigued, he makes his way back there. To his surprise, it's not flipped to the normal channel that Natalie and Cara try to deny sneaking back to watch throughout their shifts, but the local news.</p> 
										 
									<p>On the screen a reporter is standing in the middle of what looks to be Main Street, right up the road from Tino's. The wind blows her hair in her face as she attempts to report on the scene behind her involving One Dead in Fatal Hit and Run, as the caption reads. The scene looks like pure chaos: cop cars are scattered everywhere, each of their lights casting a blue and red shadow over everything; an ambulance is in the corner, medics nowhere to be found; a fire truck sits off to the side, a hose extending from it; and in the dead center of the shot is a red mustang, flipped over and smoking, tiny flames still visible.</p> 
										
									<p>Jake backs away from the TV, slowly at first and then quicker as the realization hits him. He can't handle watching another second of it, and in his rush to leave knocks over a plate of half-eaten lasagna, but he doesn't care. He has to get out of the kitchen, away from the others and the TV.</p> 
										
									<p>The dining area, normally dark after close, is dimly lit by a blue and red glow, the same one that's lighting up the crash less than a block away, and, to Jake's horror, it's what he uses to find his way towards the front of the restaurant to a table as far away from the sound of the broadcast as he can manage to stumble to. 
										
									<p>His lungs work overtime as he takes deep breaths in an attempt to calm himself down. No matter how many times he tells himself to breathe, it doesn't seem to help his racing heart or his sudden urge to vomit—neither does the lingering smell of garlic and pasta sauce that never leaves the dirty dining area of Tino's.</p> 
										
									<p>He tries closing his eyes and resting his head on the table he practically fell onto in his mad rush from the kitchen, but that only makes it worse. Instead of the flashing blue and red lights, he sees images of Kaiden, the innocent look in her eyes and then her face draining of all its color as she receives what he could only imagine was the worst news of her life. If only he had known what was happening at the time; was there something he could have done? He then remembers the favor she had asked of him earlier in the night and realizes that he never actually kept watch for her. The thought makes him even more upset, and he has to use the back of his hand to wipe away a stray tear that falls down his cheek.</p> 
										
									<p>Of all the ways he thought this night would end, he never imagined this and knows that even Natalie, with all of her pessimistic attitude, couldn't have predicted it either. It was supposed to be the best night of Kaiden's life, ending in smiles and happy tears; a night she would cherish the most over time, always looking for the chance to tell someone about. Instead, it ended up being the worst night of her life, concluding with tears that were not shed out of joy. Yes, she would look back at this in years to come, but with a pain in her heart instead of a smile on her face and Jake couldn't understand what anyone could possibly do to deserve a fate as cruel as Kaiden's.</p> 
										
									<p>He wonders where she is in this very moment and how she's handling it all. Is she standing off to the side of the road, not fully processing how much of a nightmare the scene before her is? Maybe she's in the middle of the mess, demanding to know how this tragedy occurred through the blood-curling sobs that he imagines rake her body. Or perhaps the police have reached her already, the EMTs wrapped her in one of their thermal blankets you see on first responder shows, and she's waiting to be transferred to the hospital with her boyfriend—by God, Jake hopes not. He hopes for her sake, and part of his own, that someone has come to get her, to comfort her, and take her away from it all so she can begin the slow process of healing and finding her new normal.</p> 
										
									<p>Not being able to help himself, Jake looks up to see if he can spot her for even a second, standing anywhere near the wreckage, but instead of Kaiden his eyes find the open sign and he notices that it's not working once more. The difference is that this time there isn't even a flicker of light or any sort of hint that the light will ever shine again; perhaps not as bright as it used to, but enough to tell the world that there's still hope for it. His instincts tell him to fix it, but he stops himself mid reach. There are only so many times you can trick yourself into believing something is worth the effort before you are forced to accept it's not. </p>
