										<h1>Missing Pieces</h1>
									</header>

									<p>The small break room is packed when Detective Carter Poletti walks up. On a typical day, there wouldn't be more than an officer or two occupying the space at a time, not enough to make Carter hesitate before entering. It's the strong smell of coffee and her need for yet another caffeine boost that convinces her. As she fills her cup, she notices how loud she's being or rather how quiet everyone else is. The only other sounds in the filled room come from the old tv placed in the corner. A basketball game is on and based on the way the officers clustered around the screen seem to be frozen in time, with their eyes trying to catch every detail of what's being played, it must be a good one. Before the game can end, the screen goes black, breaking the silence of the room as Carter's coworkers loudly complain, and the local news station broadcast takes its place. </p>
										
									<p><em>“Breaking news: We interrupt your regularly scheduled program with an urgent update in the Amanda Alan case. Our sources have informed us that Miss Alan, daughter of Mayor Alan, has officially been declared a missing person. The teen was last seen earlier this morning, outside the town’s local high school, but never attended any classes and hasn’t been seen or accounted for since. Up until now, the police have made no public comment although we expect-”</em></p>

									<p>Carter, and those in the breakroom along with every other person in the station she assumes, watches as the woman on screen stops mid-sentence and puts her gloved hand to her ear.</p>

									<p><em>“Ladies and gentlemen, we just received word that the police have brought in a suspect moments ago. Although we still have no comment from the chief of police, we believe this means that Amanda Alan, the beloved mayor’s daughter, might not just be a missing person, but a victim of homicide. If you, or anyone you know, has any information that might be useful to the police as they work to solve this crime, please do not hesitate to call the hotline provided on the screen below. And as always, we will continue to bring you updates as soon as we receive them. This has been Leslie with Station 7.”</em></p> 
										
									<p>The moment the news broadcast is done, it cuts back to the basketball game, one of the teams celebrating a victory but it’s long forgotten by now. Instead, the breakroom erupts in speculation about all Leslie with Station 7 had to say.</p> 
										
									<p>Carter doesn’t stick around for any of the conversations though. She grabs her coffee, sure to snatch the extra sugar packages she promised herself she’d start cutting back on, and heads to the chief’s office, knowing he’d summon her there anyways. Before she even fully closes the door, he starts in with his complaints.</p>
										
									<p>“The damn media is going to be the death of me.”</p> 
										
									<p>Carter laughs even though she doesn’t really think it’s funny, taking a seat across from him, “The media, huh? Well, it’s the Alan family that’s going to do me in.”</p> 
										
									<p>She doesn’t have to look up to know that the chief is giving her one of his infamous glares. It hasn’t been that long since she’s started here, but she’s learned a lot in the little time since then. The first thing she picked up on was that the chief, though he may be great at his job, is predictable and not very good at hiding his emotions. It’s one of the main reasons she’s come so close to inviting him to a round of poker; that and because he’s one of the few people in the station she actually doesn’t mind being around, though she’ll never admit it.</p> 
										
									<p>The other thing she’s learned, especially in the last eight hours, is that this town is run on politics. Rules don’t have to apply if you have the right amount of sway or money. This idea is great for those who do, but what about those who don’t. Carter has come to realize that those people don’t seem to matter in this town, something the chief is also aware of.</p> 
										
									<p>“Detective, need I remind you of who the Alans are? Or more importantly of the likely possibility that you’ll be looking for a new job elsewhere should you upset them in any way, especially during this case?”</p> 
										
									<p>Carter rolls her eyes, “No sir, trust me I’ve been reminded of all that enough today to last me a lifetime.”</p> 
										
									<p>The chief gives her one last look as he gets up from his desk and calls a few more officers into the room. It’s time for the department to start trying to clean up the mess the media has made.</p> 
										
									<p>Already knowing the information about to be shared, Carter moves towards the back and toons out the chief’s speech, taking the time to look around the room. The people that have been invited in are the station’s most senior officers. They stand, scattered in various positions, all of their attention appearing to be fixed on what the chief has to say. From behind, she can’t see their faces but she’s wondering how many of them are letting their mind wander like her. She can’t prove anything, but she has a feeling those who are already aware of the information have been told by the mayor himself because there’s no way all of these people are lucky enough to have kept their job for as long as they have without some of them being corrupted.</p> 
										
									<p>She finally breaks away from her thoughts and starts to listen to the chief once more as he begins to address the status of the case. He makes it clear that no suspects have been named nor has the case been declared a homicide, but that’s where he stops. He doesn’t mention that Amanda Alan has been declared a missing person, even though it’s only been seven and a half hours since she was last seen. Carter is all for getting to the bottom of every case and reuniting families with loved ones, but what she’s not all for is going about it the wrong way.</p>
										
									<p>At this point, there is no evidence suggesting that Amanda Alan is in any sort of trouble. She could very well have played hooky at a friend's house or even went on a day trip she didn’t ask permission for. There are too many different scenarios that could logically explain where Amanda is, but the media and the Alans won’t consider any. What’s worse is that, despite how much he complains about it, the chief is the one enabling them all.</p> 
										
									<p>Carter is on the verge of saying just that when a timid knock comes at the door and another officer sticks his head inside, “Sir, sorry to interrupt, but the Alans are here and have been waiting for you.”</p> 
										
									<p>The announcement becomes unnecessary as a split second later, Mayor Alan’s booming voice fills the room. “This is ridiculous! How dare you keep me waiting! My daughter, the mayor’s daughter, is missing and you are supposed to be doing something about it!”</p>
										
									<p>Carter follows the chief as he curses under his breath and quickly pushes his way out of the office. The screaming continues so the two quicken their pace as they maneuver to the mayor.</p>
										
									<p>Once there, he spots the chief in the crowd of officers and turns his rage fully onto him, even as the chief tries to calmly talk him down in order to take control of the chaos slowly erupting throughout the station. Eventually, after more yelling, some paper throwing and a lot of threats to put everyone in the building out of a job, the chief is able to get the Alans into the closest interrogation room where Carter and one other officer joins them.</p> 
										
									<p>When everyone is seated, the mayor continues: “So tell me, Detective, Chief,” Mayor Alan says, nodding at both in turn, “why did it take me calling in a false lead to Station 7’s hotline for the police station to start caring about my missing daughter?”</p> 
										
									<p>It takes Carter a second to process the absurdity of what he’s saying before she can find the words to reply, “I’m sorry, are you suggesting that you contacted the media and told them about a suspect being in custody?”</p> 
										
									<p>The mayor doesn’t answer, just sits back in his chair with his arms crossed over his chest so Carter continues, “You do realize how much trouble this is going to cause for us which is only going to make it harder to find your daughter, right?”</p>
										
									<p>This he does respond to, “Well whose problem is that? Maybe this will convince you all to work a little bit harder around here. I can’t even imagine the danger you’ve put my daughter in with the time that you’ve wasted already.”</p> 
										
									<p>Carter can feel her pulse drumming in her ears as she tries her best to choose her next words carefully, “With all due respect, Mayor, it seems to me that Amber isn’t in any danger at all. In fact, based on what we’ve been told so far, and since it’s not even been a full day since she was last seen, it’s likely that Amber left on her own accord which would make her fully capable of returning the same way.”</p> 
										
									<p>Before she even finishes, the mayor is out of his seat pointing fingers in Carter’s face, going on about how his daughter would never do such a thing. The chief finally has to cut in, pushing Carter back and doing his best to calm him down.</p>
										
									<p>As Mayor Alan continues to go on about his daughter, all she can do is watch Mrs. Alan. She sits on the edge of her seat, hands folded together on the table, and gaze pointed down. Every so often, when the mayor gets louder in his replies, her eyes dart to him and she flinches ever so slightly. After a few incidents, Carter's attention shifts to her fellow colleague standing off to the side of the Alans. He's jotting down notes on a pad of paper and eyeing the camera in the corner of the room, something Carter wishes she could do herself if she wasn't opposite of Mayor Alan and his wife.</p> 
										
									<p>Once the mayor is done with his outburst, much of his anger still directed at Carter, the chief offers his apologies, promises to keep the family updated with any information that comes in, and has the officer escort them out.</p>
										
									<p>When the door finally closes behind them, Carter voices her opinion about the lack of evidence to suggest Amanda Alan was a victim of homicide once more.</p> 
										
									<p>The chief runs a hand over his face before replying, “Detective, we’ve been over this. There’s no solid evidence to suggest she wasn’t taken, and the Alan’s have reason to believe she was so that’s what we’re going on.” When he looks back at her, he must recognize the words about to come out of her mouth because he adds, “End of discussion. Why don’t you take a breath, collect yourself, and we’ll continue this conversation tomorrow, after you’ve gone home and gotten a few hours of shut eye.” He doesn’t give her a chance to reply before leaving Carter alone in the room.</p> 
										
									<p>She lets out a sign and pushes her hair behind her ears before gathering the papers scattered along the table and messily placing them back into their designated files. She stands, moves towards the door, and yanks it open, not bothering to push in her chair or turn out the lights before leaving the interrogation room. As she walks to her desk, she purposefully fails to notice the chief beckoning to her and flops the files down once she’s there. She manages to throw her coat over her arm, unafraid of the cold night that awaits her, and is just about to take her leave when a deputy blocks her path. Without giving him a chance to speak, she side steps the deputy and hopes that’s enough to deter him from following.</p> 
										
									<p>To her dismay, it’s not as he yells after her, “Detective Poletti, there’s someone here who needs to talk to you!”</p> 
										
									<p>“Tell whoever it is to see someone else. I’m going home.”</p>
										
									<p>“But Detective, I think you might want to handle it yourself,” At this point, he’s caught up with her. The fight leaves her as she realizes this means it’s someone with information on the Amber Alan case and must be dealt with so she puts her head back for a second before nodding in response and gesturing for him to lead the way. She grabs the files back off her desk as the two head back to the interrogation room, the chair she left out greeting her as she enters.</p> 
										
									<p>On the opposite side of the table a girl sits with her hands clasped between her legs. Carter recognizes her almost immediately from some of the pictures the Alan’s brought in of their daughter earlier that day.</p> 
										
									<p>“So, they tell me you asked to speak with me directly?”</p> 
										
									<p>The girl finally looks up as she replies, “If you’re Detective Poletti, then yes, I did.”</p>
								   
									<p>Carter gives her a few minutes, hoping she’ll start to talk, before making another attempt at a conversation by asking for her name.</p>
										
									<p>“My name is Danielle, but you can call me Dani,” The girl takes a breath, seeming to gather her nerves before continuing, “Everything I say here stays between us, right? Like at a hospital, where a doctor can’t talk about a patient?”</p> 
										
									<p>Carter’s eyes flash to the camera’s blue light, indicating it’s recording, and wonders if anyone is still monitoring it at this time of night. “Nice to meet you, Dani. Well, it’s a little different than a hospital. Because this is an ongoing case, I’m going to have to share any information that might lead us to your friend, but I can do my best to help you remain anonymous if that’s what you’d like.”</p> 
										
									<p>That answer seems to satisfy Dani enough as seconds later she starts talking, blurting out everything as if she couldn’t keep the information any longer. The story she tells is just as Carter suspected; Amber Alan ran away. 
										
									<p>According to Dani, the two girls had spent the last month planning out how Amber could make a clean break, leaving both the town and her family behind. They had to gather food, supplies, and money slowly so as not to raise any suspicions. They also mapped out a few places Amber could go, but Dani doesn’t know which one Amber decided on to make sure the mayor never finds her. 
										
									<p>As she continues, Carter realizes just how much thought the girls put into their plan and how awful things must have been for Amber for her to take this drastic step. She already knows that Mayor Alan is the motivation behind the plan, but she asks anyways.</p> 
										
									<p>It takes Dani a second to answer and when she does Carter has to lean in to hear her. “I had to help her get away from him. I know he’s the mayor, but he’s not what he seems, which is why he can’t find out. Please, please don’t tell Mayor Alan.”</p> 
										
									<p>Carter can see the desperation in her eyes as she pleads with her to keep the secret. She assures Dani that the mayor won’t find out, giving her the most reassuring smile she can muster before leading her away from the interrogation room and out of the station. 
										
									<p>Once she’s out of sight, Carter heads straight into the chief’s office, who gives her a surprised look as she enters.</p> 
										
									<p>“I’ve just talked to a key witness who informed me that Amber Alan had help to run away from home because she had to get away from her dad, your wonderful Mayor Alan. It’s funny how it’s not a homicide case just like I’ve been saying all along. And I bet you the mayor has also been aware of it the entire time but wanted to make some publicity stunt out of his daughter’s suffering.”
										
									<p>“Now, come on Detective, are you sure you can trust that story?” The chief says, taken aback.</p> 
										
									<p>Carter puts her hand up and shakes her head, refusing to hear any more excuses. “That story makes more sense than everything that’s come from Mayor Alan so far. I’m sick and tired of the games being played here that are keeping me from doing my job.” She throws the files down on his desk and takes her badge from around her neck before placing it next to them. “I think you’d be better off hiring a new detective. Maybe they’ll be more inclined to follow the mayor’s orders.”</p> 
										
									<p>As Carter turns her back on the chief, who continues to call after her, and walks out of the station, she realizes Amber Alan might have had the right idea leaving this town behind.</p>
