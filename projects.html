									<p>During her time at Miami, Maddie produced many projects that utilized and strengthened her editorial skills. Included below are two that demonstrate this.</p>

									<h2>Ebook Project</h2>
									<p>In the second half of a Print and Digital Editing class, Maddie was tasked with working alongside classmates as an editorial team to produce an Ebook. The finished product was made up of personal essays and short stories focused on the future that was written and submitted by each member of the class. Her team had to work together to edit each piece, brainstorm a design concept and layout for the final product, and piece everything together before the final exam of the class.</p>

									<h2>Literary Journal Issue</h2>
									<p> For a Writing, Publishing, and Editing course students were asked to apply what they had learned throughout the semester by creating a final project that showcased their new knowledge and skills. Maddie chose to create a single issue of a literary journal. This involved: collecting writing samples, taken from places such as previous classes; editing and formatting those pieces according to the same style guide; designing the layout of the journal including the name and structure; and finally putting all of the work together to produce the finished product.</p>
